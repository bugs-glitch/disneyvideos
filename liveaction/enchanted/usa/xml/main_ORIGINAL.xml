Drawing inspiration from its classic heritage, Disney creates an inspired story unlike any you’ve experienced before. Filled with excitement, fun and incredible music from the legendary Alan Menken, ENCHANTED is the ultimate fish-out-of-water adventure. For princess-to-be Giselle, life is a fairy tale — until she’s banished from the animated land of Andalasia and thrust into the very unmagical, live-action world of modern-day Manhattan. When a cynical, no-nonsense divorce lawyer comes to her aid, little does he realize this joyful, wide-eyed innocent is about to enchant him. ENCHANTED — the musical comedy that will have your entire family under its spell. ]]></copy>

			<copy id='biog'><![CDATA[AMY ADAMS has built an impressive list of credits, challenging herself with each new role.
			
Adams will star in Mike Nichols' "Charlie Wilson's War" opposite Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The film is based on a Texas congressman Charlie Wilson's (Hanks) covert dealings in Afghanistan, where his efforts to assist rebels in their war with the Soviets have some unforeseen and long-reaching effects. Universal Pictures is scheduled to release the film on December 25th 2007.

Adams will also star in Christine Jeffs and Karen Moncrieff's "Sunshine Cleaning" opposite Emily Blunt. The dark family comedy film is about two lost sisters (Adams, Blunt) who find themselves after starting an unlikely business in crime-scene-cleanup. 

Adams recently wrapped production on Bharat Nalluri's "Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day" opposite Frances McDormand. The Universal and Focus Feature film is about a governess (McDormand) in 1938 who gets a taste of glamour when she goes to work in the home of an up and coming actress (Adams). One of the governess' chores is to sort out the actresses unrespectable affairs. 

Adams will soon start production on John Patrick Shanley's "Doubt" opposite Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Set at a Catholic school in the Bronx, the film centers on a nun who grows suspicious when a priest begins taking too much interest in the life of a young black student.

Adams’ role in Phil Morrison’s "Junebug" in 2005 earned her a nomination for a SAG Award. She won an Independent Spirit Award, Broadcast Film Critics Association Award, National Society of Film Critics Award, a San Francisco Film Critics Society Award, as well as the Breakthrough Gotham Award. Adams also won the Special Jury Prize for Acting at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival for her role as the pregnant, childlike 'Ashley,' who is awe-struck by the arrival of her glamorous sister-in-law.

Adams' other film credits include Adam McKay's "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby" with Will Ferrell, Clare Kilner's "The Wedding Date" with Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, Steven Spielberg's "Catch Me If You Can" with Leonardo DiCaprio, Reginald Hudlin's "Serving Sara," Anthony Abrams' "Pumpkin," and Michael Patrick Jann's "Drop Dead Gorgeous."  Adams' television credits include guest starring roles on "The Office" and "The West Wing."

			<copy id='biog'><![CDATA[Two-time Golden Globe nominee and 2006 SAG nominee for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Drama, can currently be seen on ABC-TV's hit medical drama, "Grey's Anatomy." "Grey's Anatomy" won the 2007 Golden Globe for Best Television Series – Drama as well as the 2007 SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.   The show also received Emmy nominations in 2006 and 2007 for Outstanding Drama Series as well as a 2005 Golden Globe nomination for Best Television Series - Drama.  Although he is perhaps best known as the unlikely heartthrob of such classic '80s nostalgia films such as "Can't Buy Me Love" and "Loverboy," Patrick Dempsey has grown into a mature actor and a talent that Hollywood continues to recognize.  He most recently starred in Richard LaGravenese's "Freedom Writers," opposite Hilary Swank and will be seen in May 2008 starring opposite Michelle Monaghan in "Made of Honor".
			
Dempsey nabbed an Emmy nomination for his portrayal of Aaron Brooks, Sela Ward's 
psychologically unbalanced brother, in the critically acclaimed television program "Once & Again."  In 2004, Dempsey co-starred in the highly-acclaimed HBO production, "Iron Jawed Angels," opposite Hilary Swank and Anjelica Huston.   

Other theatrical films include: "Sweet Home Alabama," "Scream 3," "With Honors," "Outbreak," "Hugo Pool," "The Treat," "The Palace Thief," "Heaven Help Us," " Happy Together," "Some Girls," "Coupe De Ville," "Run, Mobsters" and "In the Mood."

In 2003, Dempsey made a memorable guest appearance on NBC's hit show, "Will & Grace," as Will's love interest.  Additionally, Dempsey starred in the NBC-TV movie based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment," opposite Ben Kingsley.  He also appeared in the television miniseries "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" with Michael Caine.  He co-starred with Oliver Reed in the biblical epic "Jeremiah."  Other television movies and miniseries include:  "JFK: Reckless Youth," "A Season in Purgatory," "Blood Knot," "The Right to Remain Silent," "In a Shallow Grave" and "Blonde."

Dempsey was born and raised in Lewiston, Maine.  He first appeared onstage as David in the San Francisco production of "Torch Song Trilogy."  Other early stage work included "On Golden Pond" for the Maine Acting Company; the international touring production of "Brighton Beach Memoirs," which was directed by Gene Saks; and "The Subject Was Roses" at the Roundabout Theatre in New York.  He recently took to the stage in The Pasadena Playhouse run of  "The Importance of Being Earnest," starring as Algernon Moncrieff.

In addition to acting, Dempsey is an avid racing enthusiast and has participated in the Panoz Series and the Pro Miata series.  He currently lives in Los Angeles, California, with his wife, Jillian, and their three children Talula, Sullivan and Darby.
